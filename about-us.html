Pailona abandon us 10 years ago which makes me experience an incomplete family. Since he was separated to us we no longer have a communication with him even an update regarding about his situation right now. My mother is Joy D. Pailona, she is working abroad, striving to sustain the family financially and support our studies with my brother Joshua D. Pailona.  Someday, I will pay back all of the sacrifices that she have done. This is the reason why I am studying hard so that I will pursue all of my goals in life. My mother is the first person I really admire the most because even her husband leave his family, It's not the reason for her to give up in life, instead she strive and strive to sustain the basic needs of her family and even providing the wants of her children.</p>

I feel happy to be a part of this great school with good friends, helpful and loving teacher, and sound school administration. I have nice skills in some subjects whereas I am very weak in a few. Everybody has weaknesses, so I have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not like. While playing time, I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome my weaknesses.</p>
